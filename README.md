# Possible questions

* **What is Ven?**
  Ven is yet another toy programming language project of mine.

* **How do I run the thing?**
  *Do you really want to?*
  If you do, run `shards install` and `shards build`. And
  blame Crystal & Shards for the errors that may arise during
  the build :)
* **Can I help?**
  I don't know. Right now Ven is more of a personal project.
  Also, I barely know how to use git, let alone manage the
  thing with GitHub.
* **Why perf. is bad / code looks bad?**
  + It's a *prototype* of an *experimental*, *toy*, *fun-to-play-with*
  programming language. Which was never intended for serious use.
  + Node visitor is the quickest way to get the thing working.
  And performance doesn't really matter right now.
  + Code looks as good as I could make it, for now at least.
* **Mean time / timing process overall looks wrong?**
  Well, it seems alright to me. Could be wrong, but I'm not
  that smart to fix the problem right now.
* **`src/ven.cr` looks like a pile of garbage!**
  It's slapped together just to make the thing work.
