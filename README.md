# Ven

> And God said: `ensure "hello" + "world" is 10`

Ven is yet another toy programming language project of mine.
The reason it's here, in a state so underdeveloped, is that
I really don't want to lose it.


# How do I run the thing?

Do you really need to?

Run `shards install` and `shards build` it. And blame Crystal & Shards
for the errors that may arise during the build :)
